# Flatbox-southpaw: Rev5 Flatbox with mirrored case and rerouted PCB for left handed players! WIP!

So far it seems like everything should work as redesigned but as a warning it may not be fully functional and it may not be aligned properly right now. Once the controller is completed I will update this repo to reflect if this project is good to be built or not. Build this at your own risk. 
This repository contains 3D-printable models, PCB design files and code needed to make an arcade controller that looks like this:

The only version that has had the mirroring performed is the [rev5](hardware-rev5)
