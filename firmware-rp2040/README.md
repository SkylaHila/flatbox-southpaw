For the config, I highly recommend downloading the GP2040-CE firmware for the RP2040-Zero available at https://gp2040-ce.info/#/download

The config backup file is available in this directory, so all you need to do to get the firmware up and running is to short GP1/S2 to GND as the board gets plugged into your computer, and then going to http://192.168.7.1/ to access the web configurator, going to config, then data backup and restoration, and restoring the config from the file in this directory.
